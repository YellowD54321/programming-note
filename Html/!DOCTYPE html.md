# <!DOCTYPE html>

You tell the browser this information by adding the `<!DOCTYPE ...>` tag on the first line, where the `...` part is the version of HTML. For HTML5, you use `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

The `!` and uppercase `DOCTYPE` is important, especially for older browsers. The `html` is not case sensitive.

Next, the rest of your HTML code needs to be wrapped in `html` tags. The opening `<html>` goes directly below the `<!DOCTYPE html>` line, and the closing `</html>` goes at the end of the page.
