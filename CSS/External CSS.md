# External CSS
![[Pasted image 20220125185357.png]]

With an external CSS file, we can have one stylesheet controlling all of our pages at the same time.

Instead of a style element, where we can write the CSS, we can use a *link*, which links to our CSS file.

In the head of our document, we add:
```
<link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
